# Surveillance-and-Roadside-assitance-drone
The project is focused on designing and developing a drone for autonomous surveillance and roadside assis-
tance. This is aimed to complete the tasks of road following, arrow detection (to identify the start direction)
and object detection. Our design can be made applicable to today's freeways as under-speeding and il-
licit stoppages are always concerns for a driver. This drone can be made extremely robust with a variety
of functionalities like accident reporting, first-aid delivery in case of any emergencies, traffic law violation
reporting, etc.

The files are described below
1. computations.py:- compute the next waypoint for the drone
2. commands.py:- description of commands for various tasks like takeoff, land etc.
3. subscribers.py:- different subscribers for for ROS nodes.
4. mission.py:- test code for running the drone in a square.
5. mission1.py:- final code for running the task
6. road_follow.py:- code for roadfollowing
7. arrow detection.py:- detecting the direction of the arrow to know which direction to move in

The report describes the project and the code in more detail.
